# v6-hackathon

## Prerequisites
- Make sure you have installed vantage6 locally following [the tutorial](https://github.com/CARRIER-project/vantage6-local-setup).
- Make sure you have the newest version of vantage6
- You should have access to the [harbor server](https://harbor.carrier-mu.src.surf-hosted.nl/)

## Introduction
We are going to develop 3 types of algorithms for vantage6 and test them out on our local system.
- A simple parallel algorithm with no communication between nodes
- An algorithm that consists of 2 parts, communicating with the legacy method
- An algorithm with node-to-node communication.
